# Exercise: What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've
# attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

# Answer: This will print 'My favorite number is 7.'

# The code is asking whether or not number is true. This statement will always
# default to true if there is nothing more to evaluate.

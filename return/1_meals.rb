# Exercise: What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've
# attempted to answer.

def meal # defining method meal
  return 'Breakfast' # setting meal to return the string 'Breakfast'
end # closing method

puts meal # print what method meal returns

# Answer: It will print Breakfast; why in the comments above

# From solution: "The only way to ensure a specific return value, other than
# putting it as the last line, is to use return. When return is executed, it
# immediately exits the method, returning the provided value."

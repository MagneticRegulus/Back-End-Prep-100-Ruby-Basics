while Loops

Exercise: Locate the description of the while loop in the ruby documentation.

Answer: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-while+Loop

An important thing to note for myself is that I am using the correct core for
the version of ruby on my machine.

I then navigated to syntax > control expressions.

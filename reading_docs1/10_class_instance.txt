Class and Instance Methods

Exercise: Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path.
How are they different?

Answers:

File::path - https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/File.html#method-c-path

This returns the string representation of a path:
File.path("/dev/null")          #=> "/dev/null"

File#path - https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/File.html#method-i-path

This returns the pathname used to create the file as a string.

File.new("testfile").path               #=> "testfile"

Differences: The class method can return the stringed path of any file.
The instance method, however, will only return the stringed path of the current
file.

Contect: Instance methods are called on objects.
